2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? One challenge that occurred while creating this project was figuring out how to create a random pattern and how to create strikes. I struggled a lot in figuring out how to create a random pattern because I was not familiar with the built-in random functions. I had to look through a lot of documentation to finally understand how it worked. I also had to increase the pattern size because I decided to add four more buttons to the game. Another struggle I had was the strikes counter because I did not know the best place to run the function within the other functions. I had to think and brainstorm how the strike counter would work, increase and reset. I had to think ahead and test different ways to use the function. One way that I overcome this struggle was by really mapping out the game and different possibilities that the strike counter would successfully work. By doing this, I figured out good places to put the strike counter functions. In addition to this, I also had to figure out how to change the HTML when the strike counter changed. I used the code that I typed earlier to help me with this problem.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) A question that I had about web development was, what are the easier ways to complete this assignment? I know that in Javascript, there are frameworks that will help create this assignment easier and more efficiently. This makes me more curious about other Javascript frameworks and makes me more eager to learn them. Another question I had was how am I able to create an accurate timer for the user. I tried to create one, but it was very inaccurate because there were weird delays for the clock. I would like to learn how to create an accurate clock in the future.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) If I had more hours to work on the project, I would like to finish the timer for the game. I struggled a lot when trying to complete it, but ultimately I couldn't figure it out. I tried many methods for the timer, but there were a lot of problems with it. Another thing that I would improve would be the styling and finding a better overall theme. Currently, I think it looks pretty bland and I have some ideas on how to make it look nicer. One theme that I had in mind was a piano theme. Because I made the buttons the C Major Scale, it would be cool to make a theme around that.
